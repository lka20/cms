<h2>About</h2>
<p>
	The Field plugin allows custom data fields to be defined for <em>entity</em> types
	(entities include content items, comments, user accounts or any <b>table entity</b> in general).
	The Field plugin takes care of storing, loading, editing, and rendering field data.
	Most users will not interact with the Field plugin directly, but will instead use a <em>Field UI</em>.
	Plugin developers can use the Field API to make new entities "fieldable" and thus allow fields to be attached to them.
</p>
